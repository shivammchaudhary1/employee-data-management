## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 14.x
- MongoDB installed and running
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-data-management.git
   cd employee-data-management
   \`\`\`

2. Install server dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   cd server
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. Create a .env file in the server directory:
   \`\`\`env
   PORT=8080
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/employee-db
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d
   SALT_ROUNDS=10
   \`\`\`

4. Install client dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   \`\`\`

5. Create a .env file in the client directory:
   \`\`\`env
   VITE_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
   VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
   \`\`\`

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
   \`\`\`bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   \`\`\`

2. Start the frontend development server:
   \`\`\`bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   \`\`\`

The application will be available at:

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:8080

## üìù API Endpoints

### Authentication Routes

- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register a new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login user

### Employee Routes (Protected)

- `POST /api/employees/create` - Create a new employee
- `GET /api/employees/getAll` - Get all employees
- `GET /api/employees/get/:id` - Get employee by ID
- `PUT /api/employees/update/:id` - Update employee
- `DELETE /api/employees/delete/:id` - Delete employee

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Run the test suite:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

   For running tests with coverage:

   ```bash
   npm run test:coverage
   ```

### Frontend Tests

   For running tests in watch mode:

   ```bash
   npm run test:watch
   ```

## ü§î Assumptions and Design Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

1. **MERN Stack**: Chosen for its flexibility, scalability, and the ability to use JavaScript throughout the entire stack.

2. **Redux Toolkit**: Implemented for centralized state management to make the application more maintainable as it scales.

3. **JWT Authentication**: Used for secure, stateless authentication that works well with RESTful APIs.

4. **Modal-Based Forms**: Chosen to improve user experience by keeping users on the same page while performing CRUD operations.

### Security Considerations

1. **Password Hashing**: All passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before storage.

2. **Protected Routes**: Both frontend and backend routes are protected based on authentication status.

3. **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information is stored in environment variables instead of being hardcoded.

### Future Enhancements

1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Plans to implement different user roles (admin, manager, employee).

2. **Advanced Filtering**: Enhanced search capabilities for employee records.

3. **Data Export**: Functionality to export employee data in various formats (CSV, PDF).

4. **Audit Logging**: Track changes made to employee records for compliance and security.
